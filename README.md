Problem Statement:
When Spotify released Wrapped for the first time, I was beaten in minutes listened to music by far by my friends.  
But, I was actually listening to music on the radio all day long.  
That left me wondering how to track my record of music besides Spotif, since I liked the idea of the analysis of my listening behaviour.  
I had heard of scrobblers but never felt the urge to connect to last.fm.  
Every year every since when a new Wrapped is pubished I have to think again about my "problem".  

Timeline:
When was Wrapped released the first time!? -> Idea is born. Get Radio tracks to Spotify, run the Songs on a headless system...what a waste of energy. 
23rd of Dec. lying in bed googling stuff...Wrapped is aking me again, since my "musical age" is 66...
And I am again far behind my friends in minutes spend with music, which is unfair, bc I am listening to super good stuff all the time, but it is unrecognized, unrecorded...I am losing street credibility. 
24th of Dec. starting with some tests while everyone is getting ready for Christmas Eve, working better than expected...
API is understood and workflow is getting artist and title information. 
First scrobble is placed with pylast library. 
25th while the kids are playing with their new toys, scrobbling works with some minor (?) flaws. Waiting here for a second and 
adding exceptions there is doing the trick. 
Locally my work is done, next step docker, then unraid.
